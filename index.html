    Logan Henry is a sophomore at Penn State Berks who effectively balances his academic responsibilities with a range of extracurricular interests.
    He enjoys spending his free time with his girlfriend, exploring his various hobbies, and offering assistance to family and friends.
    Whether it’s troubleshooting a computer or working on a car, Logan is always ready to lend a hand.
    In addition to his studies, he works at his family's business under his father's guidance, gaining practical experience that aligns with his long-term career goals.
    He aspires to one day launch his own company, where he can lead a dedicated team of employees and colleagues.
  </p>
  <h2>Career</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Logan began his career at his father's business,
    <a href="https://www.ernesthenry.net/" target="_blank">Ernest Henry Auto Body</a><!--
    -->, working during his summer, winter, and spring breaks.
    During his senior year of high school, he completed an internship with the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Area_School_District" target="_blank">Fleetwood Area School District's</a>
    IT department, where he discovered his passion for the field.
    Upon graduation, he returned to the school district as a summer intern in the IT department.
    Following the internship, he was offered a position as a Level One Technician, a role he fulfilled for several months despite being unable to work full time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subsequently, he resumed work at his father's business as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeping" target="_blank">bookkeeper</a>
    and accountant.
    In this role, he organized the company’s accounts and streamlined processes such as invoicing, billing, payments, bookkeeping, and sales tax tracking, ultimately eliminating the need for a full-time position.
    The following semester, he rearranged his class schedule to work full time—serving as the bookkeeper when needed and as an auto body technician at other times.
  </p>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Logan has a diverse range of hobbies, including automobiles, computer building, music, watch collecting, camping, and hunting.
    His first vehicle was a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company" target="_blank">Hyundai</a><!--
    -->, which he acquired in a totaled condition and subsequently repaired.
    He also owns an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_F-Series" target="_blank">F-150</a>
    that he has modified with upgrades such as headers, exhaust, tuning, stereo improvements, and additional cosmetic modifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is passionate about building computers.
    Among his notable projects is a computer he built for his brother, which is used daily for gaming and schoolwork.
    Additionally, he has constructed two personal computers: one serves as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a><!--
    -->-based server running
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)" target="_blank">Docker</a><!--
    -->, and the other is dedicated to his daily schoolwork and gaming needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Logan also has a deep appreciation for music.
    He played the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet" target="_blank">trumpet</a>
    throughout middle and high school as part of the marching band, jazz band, and school band,
    and he began learning the guitar in middle school—developing proficient skills over time.
    His interests extend to collecting records, and he maintains a modest record collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, Logan collects watches, favoring brands such as
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montblanc_(company)" target="_blank">Montblanc<a/>
    and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot" target="_blank">Tissot<a/><!--
    -->. He enjoys camping as well,
    having purchased a camper from his aunt in the fall of 2024.
    In addition to these pursuits, he is an avid hunter and firearms collector—primarily hunting deer,
    though he has also hunted squirrels in friendly competitions.
    His gun collection has been enriched by firearms received from his father and grandfather.
